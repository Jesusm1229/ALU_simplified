# ALU_simplified
Simplified ALU using MUX combination logic

Objectives:

Design and implement a simplified combinational ALU circuit using the MUX technique and other MSIs for support. The circuit will be able to perform: complement of A; increment of A by one unit; decrement of A by one unit; left rotation of A (through carry).

Brief description of the practice:

Design and implement a simplified combinational ALU circuit, using the MUX technique and other MSIs for support. The input consists of the 3-bit data A and the 2-bit control word C, which will produce the following operations:

● Complement of A
● Increment of A by one unit
● Decrement of A by one unit
● Left rotation of A (through carry).

All inputs and outputs are displayed by LED's. You will decode the control signals at your discretion.

Development:

Pre-report and report can be find in the archieves
